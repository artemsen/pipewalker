PipeWalker game
***************

This is a puzzle game in which you need to combine the components into
a single circuit: connect all computers to a network server, bring water
to the taps, etc.

1. Supported command line parameters.
   -help:    help
   -version: show information about version
   -id:      start level with specified id (number from 1 to 99999999)
   -wrap:    set wrap mode (0: disable, 1: enable (default))
   -size:    set level map size (small, normal (default), big or extra)

   Usage example:
      pipewalker -id=1234 -wrap=0 -size=big

2. Themes support.
   The game supports various themes. Themes are stored as a set of textures
   in PNG file. To add a new theme - copy the PNG file to the application
   data directory:
     Linux/Unix - usually /usr/local/share/pipewalker
     MS Windows - C:\Program Files\PipeWalker\data
   The theme name is the name of the PNG file.
