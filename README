Hi All!

This is small game - PipeWalker.

This is a puzzle game where pieces of a computer network are to be 
turned in the right/left direction to make all computers connected
to the same network.

If you have any suggestions or ideas - please, contact me via e-mail
or post your message to SourceForge discussion board.

Best regards,
