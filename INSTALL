Installation Instructions (Linux)
*********************************

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd` to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure` to configure the package for your system.

     Running `configure` might take a while.  While running, it prints
     some messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make` to compile the package.

  3. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean`.

P.S. There are no `make install` command, so you have to copy binary file
     `pipewalker` and `texture` folder to some directory you wish.


Installation Instructions (MS Windows)
**************************************

     Use PipeWalker.dsp/PipeWalker.dsw to open or compile project
     with MS Visual Studio (6.0 or later).
